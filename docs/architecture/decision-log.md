# Architecture Decision Log

This log separates accepted product and architecture decisions from their current implementation
state. ADRs remain historical records; implementation notes may advance without rewriting the
original context or decision.

Read amended decisions together with their amendment notices. Sections labeled Historical
Implementation Snapshot describe their stated date, not current behavior or release obligations.
ADR 0016 is the current authority for session-oriented first-party readiness and Host action scope.
ADR 0017 records follow-up Session compatibility review and model reuse requirements without
changing the v0.1 baseline or its release gates.

Implementation states:

- **Implemented**: the decision is represented in executable code and has focused validation.
- **Partial**: a usable slice exists, but one or more stated behaviors or release checks are absent.
- **Pending**: no executable implementation exists yet.
- **Proposed**: the decision is still under discussion and does not constrain implementation yet.

## Current v0.1 Position

The aggregate gateway data plane and the ADR 0014 read-only backend management plane are complete
vertical slices. ADR 0015 establishes the composed text-Run and widget baseline. ADR 0016 defines
the completed backend contract milestone used by the subsequent first-party frontend implementation.
The following position reflects implementation progress through 2026-10-22, not completed release
acceptance.

All eight ADR 0016 backend batches are complete: decision reconciliation, source-verified contracts,
[native session use cases with durable bindings](host-session-contract.md), and typed production
assembly with explicit observer and settlement policy, timely tool/widget presentation, and
first-party HTTP/SSE with safe DTOs and Session-bound cancellation/reconciliation, and conservative
capability/availability reporting, and final OpenAPI/SSE/history schema and example freeze.
Bootstrap can select native ports and
restores unresolved ownership before all invocation, validated with controlled HTTP and real
SQLite. Native and compatibility presentation deliver attributed tool activity and optional
widgets during provider pauses, with reader cleanup and unknown-state lease retention. Host routes
are wired to production, enforce admission before SSE headers, expose recovery metadata, and keep
unknown execution owned after disconnect or sending failure. User cancel acknowledgement alone
does not release ownership. `/api/v1/capabilities` now separates local implementation, deployment
selection, remote support, and current discovery availability, using bounded read-only probes of
native and compatibility interfaces independently. Missing evidence stays unknown; Host outages
do not affect Gateway readiness. Frozen snapshots, exact public examples, production schema checks,
and controlled lifecycle tests establish all six backend frontend prerequisites. The backend's
planned v0.1 functional baseline is substantially complete, not a completed product release.

The first-party frontend functional baseline is implemented against the reviewed backend contracts:
Session creation, history and continuation, Run controls and uncertainty handling, tool activity,
page-local widgets, read-only Gateway inspection, and connection/capability status. The server can
serve compiled frontend assets and the sandbox on the same origin. Focused frontend, backend, and
static-serving checks establish implementation evidence, not complete live deployment acceptance.
Review findings remain follow-up work; functional baseline completion is not a claim that no defects
remain.

Hosting migration does not require another namespace rewrite or expand release scope. See
[Frontend Readiness and Migration Handoff](frontend-readiness.md) for artifacts, evidence,
verification commands, review priorities, and release gates. Checkout paths do not determine
product identity or runtime deployment bindings. Branding changes, exploratory proposals, and
controlled backend tests do not establish live deployment or distribution readiness.

The [OCI image](../../Dockerfile), [Compose deployment](../../compose.yaml), and
[native container workflow](../deployment/container.md) are implemented. Configuration and secrets
remain external to the image, while SQLite state uses persistent storage. Image build success has
been reported on Windows Docker Desktop; this is build evidence, not acceptance of image startup,
migrations, persistence, or shutdown. Full deployed validation of runtime integration, MCP
transports, continuation, stop/disconnect settlement, resources, and widgets remains open and is
being accumulated through actual use.

Writable topology management is outside v0.1 under ADR 0014; product Host actions are outside v0.1
under ADR 0016. Desktop and broader future ideas do not expand this milestone. Deployment acceptance,
review follow-up, and release preparation remain distinct from the implemented functional baseline.

## Future Configuration Milestone

ADR 0014 records the accepted post-v0.1 direction, not a delivered write-management feature:
first-party frontend workflows edit both Gateway topology and Mabrid's Agent Host/Target/runtime
settings through backend management APIs backed by authoritative storage. YAML product configuration
is transitional; process/deployment configuration and server-owned secret resolution remain
separate. Agent Host configuration is currently loaded from YAML at startup, not persisted merely
because Agent Sessions are persisted.

The later milestone must cover first-run setup, non-destructive edits of populated databases,
explicit migration from existing YAML/seeded state, credential references, and saved-versus-running
configuration semantics. `seed-if-empty` must not block management writes, but startup must continue
to avoid implicit YAML overwrites. Stable Session/deployment bindings, historical revision
references, and unsettled Run ownership must survive migration. This does not authorize hot reload,
remote agent administration, a multi-target registry, or implementation before a separate owner
request, and it does not reopen the completed v0.1 read-only contract baseline.
